## Country Images

Country images are stored in the `assets` folder. The application has been updated to use a new set of map-style images with a consistent visual style for all countries.

If you're setting up the application for the first time or want to update the country images, please refer to the `IMAGE_REPLACEMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` file for detailed instructions on how to prepare and install the new images.

The application will attempt to use the new map-style images first, and fall back to the legacy globe-style images if the new ones are not available.

## API

This app uses the [Radio Browser API](https://de1.api.radio-browser.info/) to fetch radio station data by country.
