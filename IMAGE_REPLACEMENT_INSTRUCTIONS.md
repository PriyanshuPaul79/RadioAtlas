# Image Replacement Instructions for RadioAtlas

## Overview
The RadioAtlas application has been updated to use a new set of country images with a consistent style. This document provides instructions on how to replace the existing globe images with new map-style images.

## Requirements
- Create or find 5 new images for the following countries:
  - India
  - Canada
  - Brazil
  - United Kingdom
  - Germany
- All images should have a similar style and visual consistency
- Recommended: Use map-style images that show the country's outline or geographical features
- Image format: JPG

The application now expects the following file names:
- `map_India.jpg`

- `map_uk.jpg`
- `map_germany.jpg`

## Installation Steps
1. Create or obtain the new images following the style guidelines above
